# How to build a pump 
___

Made for infusion of microfluidics.  

![](images/zz.jpg)

*Based on the "Open-Source Syringe Pump" developed by Andrey Samokhin*


{{BOM}}



>i **You should build two of them**
___

## Assemble the [coupling](coupling.md){Qty: 1} with the  [stepper motor](stepper.md){Qty: 1, CAT:Electronic} and the [lead screw](leadscrew.md){Qty: 1}  {pagestep}

Join the mentioned elements using a [M2.5 HEX key](hexkey.md){Qty: 1, Cat: tool}, ensuring that it is tight in all four inner screws.

## Install the guides {pagestep}

* Put the [guide rots](rots.md){Qty: 2} into the [stepper union](threeD.md){Qty:1, Cat: printedparts} and slide them until they reach the opposite face of it.
>i Press against the table to ensure that they are aligned with the face of the stepper union.

* After placing the rots, put the two M3 [nut](nuts.md){Qty: 2}s in their designated spaces and proceed to insert the [M3 - 15mm screws](fifteenMthree.md){Qty: 2} and tight using the [M3 HEX key](hexkey.md){Qty: 1, Cat: tool}.

## Screw it into the stepper {pagestep}

Put both of the structures together and ensuring that that the holes of the stepper union fits the ones on the stepper motor. Then put the [M3 - 20mm screws](twentyMthree.md){Qty: 4} into them and screw them to the end.

## Continue with the [carriage](threeD.md){Qty:1, Cat: printedparts} {pagestep}

* Place the [linear bearings](bearings.md){Qty: 2} into the carriage and hold them placing  two [nut](nuts.md){Qty: 2}s into their designated holes and then placing two [M3 - 10mm screws](tenMthree.md){Qty: 2} tightly.

* Continue by inserting the [lead screw nut](leadscrew.md){Qty: 1} into the carriage, ensuring it with two [M3 - 15mm screws](fifteenMthree.md){Qty: 2} and two [nut](nuts.md){Qty: 2}s in the opposite side.

>i **Always put the screw in opposite side holes**
>i
>i * This gives it stability. 
>i
>i * It's also possible to put them all, but is not necessary.

## Mount the carriage {pagestep}
You can manually twist the lead screw to make it go through.

## Proceed with the [syringe holder](threeD.md){Qty:1, Cat: printedparts} {pagestep}

![](images/e.jpg)

 Before assembling anything else this piece have to be prepared, for that is nesecary to do two steps:

##Step 6,1:  Heat inserts

Place the [heat inserts](heatinsert.md){Qty: 2} in the two front holes of the syringe holder with the help of a [soldering iron](soldering.md){Qty: 1, Cat: tool}. This makes easier to screw and unscrew if needed.

>! **Caution:**
>! The soldering iron works with high temperatures.

>!! **Be sure to clean the inner spaces of the knob before putting anything**
>!!
>!! ####If not it will break.

 Prepare the two [knobs](threeD.md){Qty:2, Cat: printedparts} placing a [nut](nuts.md){Qty: 2} in each knob space and then screwing the [M3 - 20mm screws](twentyMthree.md){Qty: 2} and tight with the HEX key.

## Place the side holders {pagestep}
Put one of the two [side syringe holders](threeD.md){Qty:2, Cat: printedparts} 
 in place and screw the knobs into the heat inserts.

## Place it into the guide rots {pagestep}

>i Press against the table to ensure that they are aligned with the face of the Syringe holder.

Slide the piece and screw it like the previous ones using two [M3 - 15mm screws](fifteenMthree.md){Qty: 2} with the [nut](nuts.md){Qty: 2}s.
