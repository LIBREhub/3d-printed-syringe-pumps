Background
A syringe pump is a device that delivers precise and accurate amounts of fluid over a broad range of flow rates. These devices find versatile use across various fields like healthcare, research, and development, playing a crucial role in scenarios such as controlled drug delivery in hospitals, chemical reaction control in labs, and more.

There are many 3d-printable syringe pump designs available, each with its unique features and capabilities. However, this Open-Source Syringe Pump design developed by the Mass Spectrometry Research Group, Analytical Chemistry Division, Chemistry Department of Moscow State University, appealed to our LIBRE Hub team with it's design and functionality.

Our goal with this modification and enhancement is to make this open-source syringe pump design more useful to microfluidics, and generally more accessible, adaptable, and user-friendly, thus extending its potential use within the broader community.

How do I edit the documentation?
To edit the documentation you do not need to install anything, but you will need to install something to build the final version of the documentation (such as a website). The documentation files can be opened in a plain text editor such as Windows Notepad, Notepad++, gedit, VS Code, etc. GitBuilding also comes with a browser-based editor that displays has a live display of the final HTML documentation.

If you have ever used markdown you will notice that the files you are editing are markdown files. GitBuilding uses an extended markdown syntax (that we call BuildUp). This allows you to keep track of parts in the documentation. More detail on the documentation is available on the GitBuilding website. There is also additional syntax for configuration, and for part libraries.

Contribute
Enjoy building and using your improved Open-Source Syringe Pump! We look forward to hearing about your experiences and any further improvements you might have. Make a pull-request or open an issue. For interactions in our team and with the community applies the GOSH Code of Conduct.
