# 3D printable syringe pumps and dual controller  [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

This project is a free and open-source design of versatile lab equipment - syringe pumps and a dual controller, here detailed for microfluidic droplet generation - a modification from this [Open-Source Syringe Pump design](https://doi.org/10.1134/S1061934820030156).

## Background

A syringe pump is a device that delivers precise and accurate amounts of fluid over a broad range of flow rates. These devices are versatile and can be used across various fields like healthcare, research, and development, playing a crucial role in scenarios such as controlled drug delivery in hospitals, chemical reaction control in labs, and more.

There are many 3D-printable syringe pump designs available, each with its unique features and capabilities. However, this [Open-Source Syringe Pump design](https://doi.org/10.1134/S1061934820030156) developed by the [Mass Spectrometry Research Group](https://www.mass-spec.ru/projects/diy/syringe_pump/eng/), Analytical Chemistry Division, Chemistry Department of Moscow State University, appealed to our LIBRE Hub team with its design and functionality.

Our goal with this modification and enhancement is to make this open-source syringe pump design more useful to microfluidics and generally more accessible, adaptable, and user-friendly, thus extending its potential use within the broader community.

## Usage

### Instructions
This Repository provides documentation on how to build the pumps and the controller. Just [follow the instructions here](https://librehub.github.io/syringe-pumps-and-controller/). 

This project is documented with GitBuilding - an Open Source project for documenting hardware projects. For more information on the GitBuilding project or how
to install GitBuilding, please see the [GitBuilding website](http://gitbuilding.io)

### How do I edit the documentation?

To edit the documentation, you do not need to install anything, but you will need to
install something to build the final version of the documentation (such as a website).
The documentation files can be opened in a plain text editor such as Windows Notepad,
Notepad++, gedit, VS Code, etc. GitBuilding also comes with a browser-based editor that
displays a live display of the final HTML documentation.

If you have ever used [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), you will
notice that the files you are editing are markdown files. GitBuilding uses an extended
markdown syntax (that we call BuildUp). This allows you to keep track of parts in the
documentation. More detail on the documentation is available on the
[GitBuilding website](https://gitbuilding.io/syntax/). There is also additional
[syntax for configuration](https://gitbuilding.io/syntax/buildconfsyntax) and for
[part libraries](https://gitbuilding.io/syntax/builduplibrary/).
