# 3D printable syringe pumps and dual controller

A syringe pump is a device that delivers precise and accurate amounts of fluid over a broad range of flow rates. These devices find versatile use across various fields like healthcare, research, and development, playing a crucial role in scenarios such as controlled drug delivery in hospitals, chemical reaction control in labs, and more.

There are many 3d-printable syringe pump designs available, each with its unique features and capabilities. However, [this Open-Source Syringe Pump design](https://doi.org/10.1134/S1061934820030156) developed by the [Mass Spectrometry Research Group](https://www.mass-spec.ru/projects/diy/syringe_pump/eng/), Analytical Chemistry Division, Chemistry Department of Moscow State University, appealed to our LIBRE Hub team with it's design and functionality.

### Improvements and Modifications

While we appreciated the original design, we felt it could be further enhanced for the open-source community. Some of the improvements we made include:

* Introduction of heat-inserts to replace some easy-to-fall-out nuts, enhancing the stability and user experience of the design.
* Re-doing the original documentation in the open hardware documentation format, GitBuilding while adding more practical detail (currently focussing on injection mode - withdrawl and other modes soon to be documented).
* Re-drawing of the CAD design in OnShape to make them accessible for the first time. Now, users can freely access, copy, download, and collaboratively modify the design online.
* Implementation of a new controller solution based on the original software using a Raspberry Pi Pico chip. This addition allows simultaneous control of two syringe pumps from an interface with a practical keypad.

Our primary goal with these enhancements is to make this exceptional Open-Source Syringe Pump design more accessible, adaptable, and user-friendly, thus extending its potential use within the broader community.

Enjoy building and using your improved Open-Source Syringe Pump! We look forward to hearing about your experiences and any further improvements you might make - please use GitHub issues for this purpose.
