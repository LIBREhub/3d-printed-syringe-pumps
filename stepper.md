# Stepper motor

Type of motor that converts electrical signals into discrete and precise movements in increments called steps. Unlike direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) motors that rotate continuously, a stepper motor advances in defined steps, making it ideal for applications that require precise positioning, speed control, and direction.

The stepper motor consists of a rotor with magnets and a set of electromagnetic coils called phases. When a suitable sequence of current is applied through the phases, the generated magnetic fields cause the rotor to move one step at a time.
