## Install the Raspberry Pi Pico {pagestep}

* Take the [40 pin header]{qty:1} and cut them in half.
* Solder them onto the [Raspberry Pi Pico]{qty:1}

![](images/control-interface/rpi-pico.jpg)
![](images/control-interface/rpi-pico_1.jpg)

* Place the [Raspberry Pi Pico] upside down, aligning the holes with the pins on the base.
* Ensure that the USB port aligns with the respective hole.

## Install the Motor Drivers {pagestep}

* Take 2 [TMC2209 driver]{qty:2} and attach the heatsinks.
* Make sure to attach them in the positions shown below.

![](images/control-interface/TMC2209-driver.jpg)
![](images/control-interface/TMC2209-driver_1.jpg)

* Take 7 [10 cm female-female jumper]{qty:7} and connect them to the following pins of the TMC2209 Driver.
* Repeat the process for the other TMC2209 Driver motor driver.

## Rear Cables {pagestep}

* Take 4 [20 cm female-female jumpers][20 cm female-female jumper]{qty:4} and connect them to the 4 pins shown below on one of the TMC2209 Driver.
* Thread the 20 cm female-female jumpers through the holes.
* Repeat the process for the other TMC2209 Driver. 

![](images/control-interface/TMC2209-driver-jumpers_4.jpg)
![](images/control-interface/TMC2209-driver-jumpers_5.jpg)

* Take 2 [M3 10mm screws][M3 10mm screw]{Qty: 2} and 2 [M3 nut]{Qty: 2}.
* Secure the 20 cm female-female jumpers with the [back cover][Back cover]{Qty:1, cat:printedparts}.
* Ensure that the 20 cm female-female jumpers are arranged neatly. The lid should press firmly without cutting them.
