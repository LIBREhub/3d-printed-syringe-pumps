A lead screw is a threaded shaft that converts rotational motion into linear motion.
It consists of a screw and a mating nut with corresponding threads.
The rotation of the screw causes the nut to move linearly along the length of the screw.
Lead screws are used in applications requiring precise linear motion control.
They are commonly found in CNC machines, 3D printers, robotics, and positioning systems.
