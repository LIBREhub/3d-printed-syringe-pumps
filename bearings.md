#Linear bearings


Mechanical components that facilitate smooth and precise linear motion.
They consist of an outer rail or track and a moving carriage or slider.

Rolling elements inside the bearing reduce friction and provide support for the load.
Linear bearings are used in CNC machines, 3D printers, automation systems, and more.
They improve accuracy, stability, and load-carrying capacity in linear motion applications.
