>i **You should build two syringe pumps for droplet microfluidic assays**

## Assemble the stepper motor and lead screw {pagestep}

![](images/syringe-pump/motor-leadscrew-coupling.jpg)

Insert the motor shaft of the [NEMA 17 motor]{Qty: 1} halfway into the [motor coupling][Motor coupling]{Qty: 1} and then tighten down to the motor coupling. Use a [M2.5 hex key]{Qty: 1} to tighten the motor coupling. Take the [lead screw][Lead screw]{Qty: 1}, and insert it into the motor coupling. Then, tighten the motor coupling down on the lead screw.

## Assemble the back support and linear rails {pagestep}

![](images/syringe-pump/backsup-rods-nuts-screws.jpg)

Take two [M3 nut]{Qty: 2}, insert them on the [back support][Back support]{Qty:1, Cat: printedparts} and push then in. Feel free to grab whatever tools you need to push them in. Make sure they align with the screw holes on the back support. Then, take two [M3 16mm][M3 16mm screw]{Qty: 2} and screw them just to hold the nuts. Use a [M3 hex key]{Qty: 1}.

![](images/syringe-pump/backsup-nut-screw.jpg)

Insert the [linear rails][Linear motion rod 100mm]{Qty: 2}, one into the left side and one to the right side. Make sure they insert into the holes properly and then push them through. Tighten the linear rails down on the back support.

## Assemble the stepper motor and back support {pagestep}

![](images/syringe-pump/motor-leadscrew-backsup-rails.jpg)

Insert the lead screw though the back support and align the motor holes with the screw holes on the back support. Use four [M3 20mm][M3 20mm screw]{Qty: 4} and a M2.5 hex key to tighten the back support.

## Assemble and mount the carriage {pagestep}

![](images/syringe-pump/carriage-mech-components.jpg)

Grab the [carriage][Carriage]{Qty:1, Cat: printedparts} and take the [linear bearing][Linear bearing]{Qty:2} and insert them into the side of the carriage. Then, take two [M3 nut]{Qty: 2} and insert them on the carriage and push then in. Feel free to grab whatever tools you need to push them in. Make sure they align with the screw holes on the carriage. Take two [M3 10mm][M3 16mm screw]{Qty: 2} and a M3 hex key to tighten the linear bearings.

![](images/syringe-pump/carriage-exploded-view.jpg)
![](images/syringe-pump/carriage-linearbearings.jpg)

Insert the [lead screw nut][Lead screw nut]{Qty: 1} into the carriage and tighten it to the carriage using two [M3 16mm][M3 10mm screw]{Qty: 2} and two [M3 nut]{Qty: 2}. Insert the screws in opposite side to hold the lead screw nut properly.

![](images/syringe-pump/carriage-exploded-view_1.jpg)
![](images/syringe-pump/lead-screw-nut.jpg)
![](images/syringe-pump/lead-screw-nut_1.jpg)

Push the linear rails into the linear bearings in the [carriage] and insert the lead screw into the nut. Then, manually thread it up to the middle of the linear rails.

## Assemble the front support {pagestep}

Grab the [front support][Front support]{Qty:1, Cat: printedparts}, take two [heat insert][Heat insert]{Qty:2} and positionate them in each hole of the front support. Apply heat to each insert (using a [soldering iron][Soldering iron]{Qty:1}) and use gentle force to push it into position, as described in the [guide to use heat-set inserts].

## Assemble hand knobs {pagestep}

![](images/syringe-pump/knob-mech-components.jpg)

Insert a [M3 nut]{Qty: 1} into the nut trap of the [hand knob][Hand knob]{Qty:2, Cat: printedparts}. Take a [M3 20mm][M3 20mm screw]{Qty: 2} and thread it all. Repeat this step with the second knob.

![](images/syringe-pump/knob_screw_1.jpg)
![](images/syringe-pump/knob_screw_2.jpg)

## Assemble the front support and the linear rails {pagestep}

Grab the [syringe holder][Syringe holder]{Qty:1, Cat: printedparts} and place it into the front support. Make sure the screw holes from both parts are aligned. Take the two knobs and thread them a bit.

![](images/syringe-pump/syringe-holder.jpg)
![](images/syringe-pump/syringe-holder-frontsup.jpg)

Insert [M3 nuts][M3 nut]{Qty: 2} into the nut traps of the front support. Feel free to grab whatever tools you need to push them in. Make sure they align with the screw holes on the front support. Take [M3 16mm][M3 16mm screw]{Qty: 2} and thread them enough to hold the nuts.

![](images/syringe-pump/frontsup-screw-nut.jpg)

Finally, align the linear rails with the front support to make it sure that they insert into the holes properly, and then push them through. Tighten the linear rails down on the front support.

Your syringe pump is ready to be used.
