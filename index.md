# Open-Source Syringe Pumps

The open-source syringe pump has been specifically designed for use in microfluidics. Within the realm of open-source syringe pumps, numerous designs have been developed. However, in this particular creation, we have meticulously combined the finest features available. The major breakthrough achieved in this development lies in its remarkable capability to operate seamlessly with extraordinarily low flow rates, distinguishing it from its counterparts. As a result, it has been able to excel in the field of microfluidics

This consists of two main parts: the interface and the pump.
